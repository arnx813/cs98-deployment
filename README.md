# Project Name

We are building Dataset Nexus, a platform enabling users to buy and sell datasets for ML training. Our focus is on hobyyists and the more tail-end of the market, as there are other providers in the higher end market: Scale AI and LabelBox.

## Architecture

Spring Boot for the backend. Potentially Google Firebase for the database. React JSX for the front end.

## Setup

To get the project dev environment up and running locally, clone the repo. After successfully cloning, `cd` into the the main directory that contains cloned data. Run `npm install` and this will automatically install any dependencies and packages you might have missing. After succesfully running npm install, run `npm run dev` and this will automatically start up the project dev environment. Follow instructions on terminal to access what port the dev environment is hosted on.

## Deployment

Must start backend server in the project-dataset-nexus-backend repo and follow the instructions set out in [react-boilerplate](react-boilerplate.md)
