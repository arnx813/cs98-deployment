# Project Name

TODO: super short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups that you keep up-to-date.

## Architecture

Spring Boot for the backend. Potentially Google Firebase for the database. React JSX for the front end.

## Setup

To get the project dev environment up and running locally, clone the repo. After successfully cloning, `cd` into the the main directory that contains cloned data. Run `npm install` and this will automatically install any dependencies and packages you might have missing. After succesfully running npm install, run `npm run dev` and this will automatically start up the project dev environment. Follow instructions on terminal to access what port the dev environment is hosted on.

## Deployment

Must start backend server in the project-dataset-nexus-backend repo and follow the instructions set out in [react-boilerplate](react-boilerplate.md)
